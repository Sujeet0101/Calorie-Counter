Calorie Counter

Calorie Counter application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to set a daily calorie budget and track their calorie intake from meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) and exercise.

Here's a brief description of the features and functionality:

Input Form: Users can input their daily calorie budget, add entries for meals and exercise, and calculate the remaining calories.

Add Entry: Users can select the type of entry (meal or exercise) from a dropdown menu and add multiple entries for each type. Each entry consists of a name (e.g., food item or exercise type) and the corresponding calorie count.

Calculate Remaining Calories: Upon submitting the form, the application calculates the total consumed calories from all meal entries and subtracts them from the daily calorie budget. It also adds any calories burned from exercise. The remaining calories are displayed along with a message indicating whether there is a surplus or deficit.

Clear Form: Users can clear the form inputs and reset the application to its initial state.

Styling: The application has a clean and responsive design, with a color scheme that provides visual cues for calorie surplus and deficit.

Overall, the Calorie Counter provides a simple and effective way for users to track their calorie intake and monitor their progress towards their daily goals.
